# Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains assignments and implementations from my Course titled Foundations of Artificial Intelligence. It consists of a variety of core AI algorithms like search problems, constraint satisfaction, adversarial search, MinMax games, heuristics and optimization techniques.

## Topics Covered

### Search Problems
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search
- Greedy Best-First Search
- 8-Puzzle Solver using various heuristics (Manhattan, Out-of-sequence)

### Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
- Variable and Constraint classes
- Generic CSP solver using DFS
- N-Queens problem modeled and solved as a CSP

### Adversarial Games
- Minimax algorithms

### Problem Formulations
- Water Jug (Decantation) Problem using BFS
- Custom search graph problems with heuristic and cost functions
